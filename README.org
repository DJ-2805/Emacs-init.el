* Emacs-Init File
This is my customization for my Emacs editor. The myinit.org has the main components of the customization
The init.el file connects to the .org file and runs it for Emacs.
Most of this customization comes from Mike Zamansky's "[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9KxKa8NpFxIcNQa9js7dQQIHc81b0-Xg][Using Emacs]]" playlist on youtube.
